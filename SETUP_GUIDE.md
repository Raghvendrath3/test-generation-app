# Test Generation App - Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

Run the following command in your project directory:

\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

This will install all required packages including:
- **better-sqlite3** - Local SQLite database
- **Next.js** - React framework
- **jsPDF & html2canvas** - PDF generation
- All UI components and utilities

### 2. Verify Installation

After installation, verify that `better-sqlite3` was installed correctly:

\`\`\`bash
npm list better-sqlite3
\`\`\`

If you see an error about `better-sqlite3` not being installed, try:

\`\`\`bash
npm install --save better-sqlite3
\`\`\`

### 3. Run the Development Server

Start the development server:

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

The app will be available at: **http://localhost:3000**

### 4. Create Your First Account

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Create Account"
3. Fill in the registration form:
   - **Full Name**: Your name
   - **Email**: Your email address
   - **Role**: Select "Teacher" or "Student"
   - **Password**: Create a strong password
4. Click "Create Account"

If you get a 500 error, check the following:

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "better-sqlite3 is not installed"

**Solution:**
\`\`\`bash
npm install better-sqlite3
\`\`\`

If that doesn't work, try:
\`\`\`bash
npm install --build-from-source better-sqlite3
\`\`\`

### Error: "Cannot find module 'better-sqlite3'"

**Solution:**
1. Delete `node_modules` folder
2. Delete `package-lock.json`
3. Run \`npm install\` again

### Error: "ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'data/test-app.db'"

**Solution:**
This error should be automatically fixed by the updated code. The app will create the `data` directory if it doesn't exist. If the error persists:

1. Manually create a `data` folder in your project root
2. Restart the development server

### Error: "Database is locked"

**Solution:**
1. Stop the development server (Ctrl+C)
2. Delete the `data/test-app.db` file
3. Restart the development server

### Port 3000 Already in Use

**Solution:**
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev -- -p 3001
\`\`\`

This will run the app on port 3001 instead.

## Database

The app uses **SQLite** with the following features:
- **Location**: `data/test-app.db` (created automatically)
- **Tables**: Users, Subjects, Chapters, Questions, Tests, Student Attempts, Results
- **No external database needed** - Everything runs locally
